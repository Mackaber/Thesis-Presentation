abstract = "The literature on exchange of indivisible goods finds natural application in the exchange of live donor kidneys for transplant. However, in kidney exchange, there are constraints on the size of exchanges. Initially, kidney exchanges are likely to be between just two patient–donor pairs. We show that, although this constraint eliminates some potential exchanges, there is a wide class of constrained-efficient mechanisms that are strategy-proof when patient–donor pairs and surgeons have 0–1 preferences. This includes deterministic mechanisms that accommodate the priority setting that organ banks currently use to allocate cadaver organs, and stochastic mechanisms that allow distributive justice issues to be addressed."

abstract="The Hospitals/Residents problem with Couples (HRC) is a generalisation of the classical Hospitals/Residents problem (HR) that is important in practical applications because it models the case where couples submit joint preference lists over pairs of hospitals (hi,hj). We consider a natural restriction of HRC in which the members of a couple have individual preference lists over hospitals, and the joint preference list of the couple is consistent with these individual lists in a precise sense. We give an appropriate stability definition and show that, in this context, the problem of deciding whether a stable matching exists is NP-complete, even if each resident's preference list has length at most 3 and each hospital has capacity at most 2. However, with respect to classical (Gale-Shapley) stability, we give a linear-time algorithm to find a stable matching or report that none exists, regardless of the preference list lengths or the hospital capacities. Finally, for an alternative formulation of our restriction of HRC, which we call the Hospitals/Residents problem with Sizes (HRS), we give a linear-time algorithm that always finds a stable matching for the case that hospital preference lists are of length at most 2, and where hospital capacities can be arbitrary.",

abstract="The Hospitals / Residents problem with Couples (hrc) is a generalisation of the classical Hospitals / Residents problem (hr) that is important in practical applications because it models the case where couples submit joint preference lists over pairs of (typically geographically close) hospitals. In this paper we give a new NP-completeness result for the problem of deciding whether a stable matching exists, in highly restricted instances of hrc, and also an inapproximability bound for finding a matching with the minimum number of blocking pairs in equally restricted instances of hrc. Further, we present a full description of the first Integer Programming model for finding a maximum cardinality stable matching in an instance of hrc and we describe empirical results when this model applied to randomly generated instances of hrc.",

 abstract = {Competitive adjustment processes in labor markets where firms and workers are heterogeneous but well informed are studied. A natural notion of equilibrium for such markets is defined, and a plausible adjustment process is shown under reasonable assumptions always to converge to an equilibrium; this allows a generalization of several existence results in the literature. Finally, the relationship between market institutions (such as who makes offers) and which of the range of equilibria that heterogeneity makes possible arises, is studied. Generalizing results of Gale and Shapley and Shapley and Shubik, it is shown that all agents on a given side of the market agree on which is the best equilibrium, and that the equilibrium that emerges is the one most favored by the agents on the side of the market that makes offers in the adjustment process. The process can also be viewed as an algorithm for transportation and optimal assignment problems.},
